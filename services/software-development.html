          <p>When we hear about it we all really become curious as to what really software designing is, so let’s have a brief discussion about <strong>Software Development</strong>.</p>
            <br />
          <h5><strong>What is software?</strong></h5>
          <p>It is a normal term for the different kinds of program that we run on our computer and other things also. The <strong>Software Development</strong> is opposite to hardware as it helps the computer work from outside whereas software helps it to work from inside. The software is divided into different forms like:</p>
          <ul class='collection'>
              <li class='collection-item'>Application software</li>
              <li class='collection-item'>System software</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>We can purchase different kinds of software from the market. We get software often in the form of pen drives, just the way you share stuff with your buddies.</p>

          <ul class='collection with-header'>
              <li class='collection-header'><h5>Some of the software’s we can buy are</h5></li>
              <li class='collection-item'>Corel Draw</li>
              <li class='collection-item'>CAD/CAM</li>
              <li class='collection-item'>The Software for Presentation etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So let’s know what really <strong>Software Development</strong> is, it is the development or one must say the process of making software in an orderly way. It is a complete process of designing, coding, testing etc. As the world is moving towards digital development the software field is also making its way through it in high level. So this <strong>Software Development</strong> has the process of making it and it has the step by step method like we need to plan, analysis, etc. Let’s go through it:</p>
            <p>Before we start making anything there is always a planning for it. We need to plan and with a perfect plan and knowledge, knowing about positives and negatives everything is necessary for the development of the software. As planning helps to run the project smoothly and in a perfect manner.</p>
            <p>Then we need to analyze about what will be the work of the <strong>Software Development</strong>, how is it going to work and we need to make notes for what are the requirements etc.</p>
          <p>Then we need to design the architect of the project of what will the software be about and how will it work it helps in lessening the faults if we work as our plan.</p>
          <p>Then here comes the most important task of development of the software this is what we are talking about so in the fourth step the development takes place, it starts from here by recording the data. So when the <strong>Software Development</strong> is made completely it is sent for the implementation where it is checked if it is working correctly or not.</p>
          <p>Then comes the process of testing here it is checked that if there is an issue or problem in the software like errors or data bugs.</p>
          <p>After going through the process the <strong>Software Development</strong> goes through the maintenance where the updates from time to time are checked and the changes take place under the maintenance program. </p>
          <p>This process is simple and easy way of developing a software as software has been really helpful lately in every field of medicine, fashion, education etc so the development of software have also increased.</p>
          
          <ul class='collection with-header'>
              <li class='collection-header'><h5>Let&apos;s see what the profits of Software Development are</h5></li>
              <li class='collection-item'>Cost Effectiveness</li>
              <li class='collection-item'>Quicker time to market</li>
              <li class='collection-item'>Accessibility of Qualified IT Team</li>
              <li class='collection-item'>Versatile human resources consumption</li>
              <li class='collection-item'>Improvement risk minimization</li>
              <li class='collection-item'>Privacy of proprietary information and facts Protection towards Technological Changes</li>
          </ul>
